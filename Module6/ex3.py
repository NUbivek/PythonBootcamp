# Write an inseartion sort function.

# Insertion sort is a common sorting algorithm that, while still its worst case is 
# still O(n**2), it is much more efficient than Bubble sort on average.

# According to wikipedia, when people manually sort something, 
# like a deck of cards for example, most use a method similar to insertion sort.

# alist = [54,26,93,17,77,31,44,55,20]
