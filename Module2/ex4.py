# Exercise 4: One of the first known examples of encryption was used by Julius Caesar. 
# Caesar needed to provide written instructions to his generals, but he didnâ€™t want his enemies 
# to learn his plans if the message slipped into their hands. As result, he developed what later became 
# known as the Caesar Cipher. The idea behind this cipher is simple (and as a result, 
# 	it provides no protection against modern code breaking techniques). Each letter in the 
# original message is shifted by 3 places. As a result, A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes F, 
# D becomes G, etc. The last three letters in the alphabet are wrapped around to the beginning: 
# X becomes A, Y becomes B and Z becomes C. Non-letter characters are not modified by the cipher. 
# Write a program that implements a Caesar cipher. Allow the user to supply the message and the shift amount, 
# and then display the shifted message. Ensure that your program encodes both uppercase and lowercase letters. 
# Your program should also support negative shift values so that it can be used both to encode messages and decode messages. 
# Hints: ord(), chr()
